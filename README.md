#Drowsinnes Detection

Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents caused by drivers who fall asleep while driving.

This Python project aims to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Please reach out to me for the entire source code as one of the files was too big to be uploaded.
